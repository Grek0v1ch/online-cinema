## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to write and configure microservices that interact with each other for an online cinema.
## Folder Structure Explained

The project's folder structure is designed for clarity and modularity. Here's an overview of the key folders and their contents:

- **cinema-library**: microservice for working with movies.
- **users**: microservice for working with users.
- **protobufs**: It contains special *.proto files designed to create source code for clients and servers.
- **cinema-app**: microservice for working through the web interface, connects the "cinema-library" and "users".
